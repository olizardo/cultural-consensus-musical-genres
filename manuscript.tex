\section*{Introduction}
The notion of musical genre stands as a fundamental concept within the Sociology of Taste, operating as a key organizing principle in understanding cultural consumption and preference \citep{dimaggio1987classification-758, lena2012banding-4b5, lena2008classification-1d7}. Despite its centrality, genre remains a perennially contested category \citep{lena2015relational-21f, vlegels2017music-360}. A core challenge lies in the disparity between intuitive understanding, which suggests that genres are fuzzy, overlapping, and problematic in their boundaries \citep{lizardo2024from-ddd, goldberg2016what-4e3}, and traditional sociological methodologies that often rely on crisp classifications of genre boundaries and measurements of central tendencies \citep{monk2022inequality-699}. This inherent tension has previously led to calls for either outright rejection or radical revision of the genre concept itself \citep{lena2015relational-21f}.

Recent advancements in the field of culture measurement have begun to provide promising avenues for addressing this conundrum. Specifically, relational approaches utilizing network methods and Geometric Data Analysis have emerged, focusing on the inherent fuzziness and overlapping nature of categories \citep{lizardo2024from-ddd}. These methodologies shift the analytical focus towards the distributions of judgments within a relational space \citep{puetz2017fields-f30}. Conceptually, this work employs relational imagery to deconstruct categories as clusters of associations between elements \citep{mcdonnell2024making-b02}, thereby revealing ``folk categories'' by empirically measuring what elements are perceived to ``go with what'' at the level of individual cultural understanding \citep{goldberg2018beyond-f2f}. A key benefit of these approaches is their ability to illuminate heterogeneity across clusters of individuals and cultural items \citep{goldberg2011mapping-77a, vlegels2017music-360}.

Historically, the sociology of taste has concentrated on the objective dual linkage between two primary systems of categories: Genre categories, as developed within cultural production fields like scenes and industries, and social categories, endowed with ritual potency and constitutive of status orders \citep{bourdieu1984distinction-835, bourdieu1993field-8ad, dimaggio1987classification-758, lena2012banding-4b5}. This framework operates on the basic intuition that genres are defined by the types of people who prefer them, and, conversely, categories of people are defined by the genres they choose \citep{breiger2000tool-db3, lizardo2016cultural-aaa}. However, a less common focus in research has been the direct examination of folk construals of these dual linkages, that is, how individuals subjectively perceive the connections between musical genres and social groups \citep{lizardo2016cultural-aaa}.

This paper applies insights derived from the relational, geometric, and schematic turns in measuring culture \citep{goldberg2011mapping-77a, rouanet2000geometric-a44} to the enduring problem of genre within the sociology of taste. My primary objective is to transition analytical perspectives from crisp definitions to fuzzy categories, emphasizing heterogeneity and the distribution of judgments across the social space \citep{romney1986culture-aaa}. Beyond the exclusive focus on objective linkages between genre categories and socio-demographic positions, I aim to investigate folk schemas concerning the subjective folk construals of the link between genre categories and categories of people. By exploiting the sociological duality of genres and social labels \citep{basov2017duality-24b, breiger1974duality-1d0}, I seek to extract detailed associational schemas for both. This involves combining network-analytic and geometric methods to simultaneously examine both central tendencies (centroids) and heterogeneity (variance) in these perceived associations across multiple analytical levels: individual, category, group (demographics), and the broader system.

\section*{Data and Analytic Approach}
To achieve these objectives, I analyze a comprehensive dataset on cultural tastes, collected in the Summer of 2012 from a weighted representative sample of Americans (N = 2,250) \citep{lizardo2016cultural-aaa, lizardo2015musical-8c6, lizardo2024from-ddd}. This dataset, similar to the GSS 1993 survey, includes items assessing respondents' likes, dislikes, and frequency of consumption across twenty distinct musical style categories. Crucially, this dataset incorporates a \textit{perceptual} module that prompted respondents to identify characteristics describing the typical fans of each genre category, allowing them to select all applicable traits from a predefined list of socio-demographic labels (e.g., Male, Female, Young, College Educated, Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and various social classes). 

\subsection*{Averaged Genre Associations}
Figure~\ref{fig:main} shows a heatmap plot of the proportion of respondents associating each genre with each of the fifteen social labels included in the survey, reproducing one of the key results from \citet[Table 3]{lizardo2016cultural-aaa}. As we can see, respondents use social labels associated with gender fairly indiscriminately, associating them with each genre at a fairly high rate. Racial categories are used in a more discriminating manner, reproducing (on average) standard stereotypes of genre audiences. Rock and traditional ``highbrow" genre categories are associated with white audiences, while Rap, Blues, R\&B, Reggae, and Gospel are associated with Black audiences, and Latin music is associated with Hispanic audiences. The category of Asian is not strongly associated with any genre. Both age and class/education categories also reproduce expected stereotypes. For instance, Rap and Metal are considered ``young'' genres. At the same time, Classic Rock and Country are thought of as ```middle-aged.'' In the same way, Classical and Opera audiences are considered educated and Upper Class, while Bluegrass and Country audiences are considered not college educated and working or lower class.

    \caption{Heatmap matrix of the proportion of respondents associating each one of fifteen social labels (columns) with one of twenty musical genre categories (rows).}
    \label{fig:main}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Cognitive Two Mode Networks}
The data used to construct Figure ~\ref{fig:main} consists of averages of more than two thousand binary matrices---one for each respondent---of the same dimensions as~\ref{fig:main} provided by each respondent. As such, the averaging hides as much as it reveals, even as it produces intuitive results. The methodological approach taken here treats this rich disaggregated association data as cognitive two-mode data, conceptually analogous to Krackhardt-style data used in one-mode networks \citep{batchelder1997consensus-f5c, kumbasar1994systematic-213}, where each person provides their perceived associations between musical genres and social labels. In terms of recent work on measuring culture, each person-level two-mode data table records the (explicit) schematic structure of how individuals perceive each genre category relative to the set of social labels \citep{hunzaker2019mapping-280}.

More formally, each individual provides a ``personal'' two mode network of genres by social labels with corresponding affiliation matrix $\mathbf{A}(p)$, where $a^{(p)}_{gl} = 1$ if individual $p$ associates genre $g$ with label $l$. Following \citet{breiger1974duality-1d0}, the personal genre projection is given by:

\begin{equation}
   \mathbf{G}(p) = \mathbf{A}(p)\mathbf{A}(p)^T 
\end{equation}

Where $g^{(p)}_{ij}$ records the $p^{th}$ individual's perceived similarity between genres $i$ and $j$ based on their shared labels and $g^{(p)}_{ii}$ records the number of times individual $p$ associates genre $i$ with a label.

In the same way, the personal label projection is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{L}(p) = \mathbf{A}(p)^T\mathbf{A}(p)
\end{equation}
 
Where $l^{(p)}_{kl}$ records the $p^{th}$ individual's perceived similarity between labels $k$ and $l$ based on their shared genres, and $l^{(p)}_{kk}$ records the number of times individual $p$ associates genre $i$ with a label. The structure of the data thus allows us to take a ``Mondo Breiger'' approach \citep{lee2018doorway-008}, where we can perform dual projections at the level of each individual. 

\subsection*{Individual Backbone Extraction}
Because each dual projection is likely to over-estimate the perceived similarities between genres and labels at the level of the individual, I use backbone extraction on each individual-level projection---more specifically, the Stochastic Degree Sequence Model (SDSM)---to isolate the most significant genre-to-genre and label-to-label associations for each person \citep{neal2014backbone-b29}. 

The SDSM works as follows: In the first step, a generalized linear model for binary outcomes (binomial family with logit link function) is used to predict the probability of a tie between each genre and label in the two-mode network, using the number of times a genre was associated with social label and the number of times a social label was associated with a genre (the degrees of the nodes in each mode) and their interaction as predictors. From the predicted probabilities derived from this model (where the unit of analysis is the genre/label pair), we generate an ensemble of two-mode networks as Bernoulli draws from the vector of predicted probabilities, compute row and column projections for each, and estimate the proportion of times that the projected edge weight between pairs of genres and pairs of labels is smaller in the generated projection ensemble than that observed in the original network projection. We then assign a binary link between two genres and two labels in the corresponding backbone (indicating perceived similarity) if this percentage falls below a certain threshold. In these data, the usual $\alpha < 0.05$ criterion proves to be too strong (generating mostly empty backbones) for each genre-to-genre and label-to-label projection. Accordingly, I use a less stringent criterion of $\alpha < 0.45$.

\section*{Workflow Illustration}
Figure~\ref{fig:ind-ex-aff} shows the cognitive two-mode network matrices of the associations between genres and social labels for two individuals in the data. It is clear from this example that the averaged associations shown in Figure~\ref{fig:main} hide quite a lot of individual variation and idiosyncratic perceptions of what goes with what \citep{goldberg2018beyond-f2f}. For instance, Case ID 65 believes that Heavy Metal encompasses most types of people, regardless of gender and race (excluding Asians), but thinks that Jazz music only appeals to older white or Hispanic people with a college degree. Case ID 236, on the other hand, suggests that Metal fans are mostly young, white, working-class men. However, classical music appeals to most people regardless of gender, race (excluding Asian and Hispanic populations), and age, although these individuals are not typically working-class.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ind-ex-rp} shows the individual row projections ($\mathbf{G}(p)$) and corresponding backbones for each of these two cases, encoding the perceived similarities between genres and social labels for each individual. We can see, for instance, that in accordance with their cognitive two-mode network, which sees the Metal audience as relatively undifferentiated, Case ID 65 does not strongly associate Metal with any other genre, except contemporary rock and classical (the last a fairly idiosyncratic linkage). In the same way, Case ID 236 sees Classical and Opera as strongly linked, and Metal as most similar to such genres as Reggae, Rap, Alt Rock, and Contemporary Rock. 

The corresponding column projections ($\mathbf{L}(p)$) and backbones for these two cases are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ind-ex-cp}. As we can see, Case ID 65 identifies the label ``white" as most similar to ``College Educated" and "=``Upper Class," whereas Case ID 236 only associates ``white" with ``Middle Class." Similarly, Case ID 65 sees the label ``Upper Class'' as most similar to ``White,'' ``Female,'' and ``Young,'' but Case ID 263 sees the same label as most similar to ``Old'' and ``Middle Class.''

Once we have computed the genre and label projection backbones for each individual in the survey, we stack these matrices, generating two tables of dimensions $(N \times 20) \times 20$ (for genres) and $(N \times 15) \times 20$ (for labels). We then compute the spectral decomposition of these two matrices using Correspondence Analysis (CA). This analytical framework thus generates three sets of scores: person-specific judgments of the relative similarity of genres and labels (row scores), aggregate or consensus judgments across all individuals of genre and label similarity (column scores), and supplementary scores for genres and labels representing the centroid of the cloud of person-specific judgments \citep{kumbasar1994systematic-213}. These scores are then analyzed using Geometric Data Analysis (GDA) methods \citep{rouanet2000geometric-a44}. Ultimately, this approach allows me to examine heterogeneity in folk understandings by observing how multiple clouds of individuals (projected into both genre and social label spaces) distribute themselves along principal axes, providing critical insights into the variation in meaning consensus across different levels of analysis. The resulting data workflow is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}.

\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Consensus Scores Biplots}
We begin by examining CA biplots of the consensus (column) scores for both genres and labels. Figure~\ref{fig:ca-genre-biplot12} shows the correspondence plot for genres along the first two dimensions, with the color intensity of the genre label proportional to their contribution to the first two dimensions. We can see that the CA results split the twenty genres into three well-separated groups. 

\begin{figure}[t]
    \captionsetup[subfigure]{font=footnotesize,labelfont=footnotesize}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[trim={0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm},clip, width=0.6\textwidth]{Plots/ca-genre-col12.png}
    \caption{Correspondence plot of consensus column scores for genres (dimensions one and two).}
    \label{fig:ca-genre-biplot12}
\end{figure}

Along the first (horizontal) dimension, the more traditional ``highbrow'' (artistically consecrated) genres (Classical, Opera) on the right are contrasted to such genres as Metal, Rap, and Reggae on the left. On the second (vertical) axis, these genres are contrasted with genres such as Gospel, Folk, and Bluegrass (at the bottom), which are more traditionally associated with rural or religiously observant America. 

\begin{figure}[t]
    \captionsetup[subfigure]{font=footnotesize,labelfont=footnotesize}

        \includegraphics[trim={0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm},clip, width=0.6\textwidth]{Plots/ca-genre-col13.png}
    \caption{Correspondence plot of consensus column scores for genres (dimensions one and three).}
    \label{fig:ca-genre-biplot13}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ca-genre-biplot13} shows the same biplot as Figure~\ref{fig:ca-genre-biplot12} but with the third dimension scores on the vertical axis. We can see that the third dimension primarily separates the cluster of ``popular culture'' genres by the perceived race of the audience, with those popular genres which are see as preferred by Black or Hispanic people (Rap, Reagge, Latin, Blues, and Gospel) toward the top, and those whose audiences are seen as overwhelmingly white toward the bottom (Metal and various flavors of Rock). 

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{Correspondence plot of consensus column scores for social labels (dimensions one and two).}
    \label{fig:ca-label-biplot12}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ca-label-biplot12} shows the corresponding consensus biplot for social labels for the first two dimensions. We can see that the main action happens along the first (horizontal) axis, which separates labels according to Race, Age, and Class, with working and lower class, young, Black, Hispanic, and No College on the left, and Middle Age, Old, Upper and Middle Class, and College Educated on the right. Gender Labels are toward the plot's origin (indicating no strong association with either dimension). The second dimension is just a residual axis, separating the seldom-used label of ``Asian'' from the rest. 

\begin{figure}[t]

    \label{fig:ca-label-biplot13}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ca-label-biplot13} shows the same biplot as Figure~\ref{fig:ca-label-biplot12} but with the third dimension scores on the vertical axis. We can see that the third dimension separates the gender labels (which are perceived by people to be similar to the racial labels of ``white" and ``middle-aged") from the rest, positioning them at the bottom of the plot. 
\subsection*{Fuzzy Biplots for Genres}
While the consensus scores provide insightful information of the way that persons classify genres and labels \textit{on average}, as we noted at the outset, this hides as much as it reveals. For each of the genres and labels shown in the previous figure is actually a \textit{distribution} (a ``cloud'' of points in GDA parlance) of the audiences pertaining to each genre. The patterning of this distribution can be seen by plotting the \textit{clouds} instead of the single consensus score in a CA biplot.

Figure~\ref{fig:genre-fuzz} shows a series of such fuzzy biplots for selected genres. Each figure presents a two-dimensional density plot, with each cloud of points marked by a different color, and with darker shading corresponding to the densest regions of the plot for each cloud. As we can see in Figures~\ref{fig:genre-fuzz-a}-\ref{fig:genre-fuzz-c}, genres belonging to the three main clusters distributions in Figure~\ref{fig:ca-genre-biplot12} show up as fuzzy clouds of points that, while partially overlapping, exhibit strong separation. Meanwhile, as shown in Figures~\ref{fig:genre-fuzz-d}-\ref{fig:genre-fuzz-f}, when we plot clouds of points corresponding to genres in the same general cluster (like Rap, Reggae and blues, or Classic Rock, Country, and Folk, or Classical, Opera, and Broadway Musicals), we end up with strongly overlapping clouds. Some genres, such as Jazz in Figures~\ref{fig:genre-fuzz-d} and~\ref{fig:genre-fuzz-e}, occupy bridging positions, nearer the center of the plot and overlapping with otherwise distinct clusters of genres. This position of Jazz in the popular imagination corresponds to the historical trajectory of the genre in the field of production in the United States, which combined folk, popular, and classical music practices \citep{lopes1999diffusion-1fa}.
